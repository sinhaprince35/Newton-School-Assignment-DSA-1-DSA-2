/*
Operations on Deque
easy
Problem Statement
Given a Deque and Q queries. The task is to perform some operation on Deque according to the queries as described in input:

Note:-if deque is empty than pop operation will do nothing, and -1 will be printed as a front and rear element of queue if it is empty.
Input
User task:
Since this will be a functional problem, you don't have to take input. You just have to complete the functions:
push_front_pf():- that takes the deque and the integer to be added as a parameter.
push_bac_pb():- that takes the deque and the integer to be added as a parameter.
pop_back_ppb():- that takes the deque as parameter.
front_dq():- that takes the deque as parameter.

Constraints:
1 <= N(Number of queries) <= 103

Custom Input:
First line of input should contain the number of queries Q. Next, Q lines should contain any of the given operations:-
For push_front use pf x where x is the element to be added
For push_rear use pb x where x is the element to be added
For pop_back use pp_b
For Display Front use f
Moreover driver code will print
Front element of deque in each push_front opertion
Last element of deque in each push_back operation
Size of deque in each pop_back operation
Output
The front_dq() function will return the element at front of your deque in a new line, if the deque is empty you just need to return -1 in the function. */
